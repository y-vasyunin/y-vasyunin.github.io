## Who am I?

My name is Yaroslav, and I am a specialist in **digital geography** and **cloud technologies**. Outside of work, I apply my skills to research and creative projects. For example, I search for traces of ancient civilizations in the Amazon and create maps of fantasy worlds.

I was born in Moscow, and since 2019 I have been living in Veneto ‚Äî a northern region of Italy that was once the heart of the Venetian Republic. I am fluent in English and Italian, and I can read Spanish and Portuguese. Recently, I started learning Japanese. I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, and sharing knowledge. I am also a blood donor and a volunteer for the World Wildlife Fund.

## What do I do?

Since 2011, I have been professionally involved in geoinformatics and spatial data analysis. My career began in Russia, where I worked with satellite imagery, developed GIS systems for infrastructure projects, monitored natural resources, and automated spatial analysis. In addition to applied work, I taught at **Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN)**, developed academic programs, and gave lectures on remote sensing and GIS.

After moving to Italy, I spent a couple of years working on geoinformation solutions for municipalities. Now, I work at the Italian office of [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/ecosystem-partners/google-cloud), specializing in cloud technologies and data analytics. Here, I create solutions that help clients migrate their digital infrastructure to the cloud and use it effectively.

I also have several hobby projects that allow me to apply geoinformation technologies in unexpected fields:
- [**Paititi Research**](https://www.paititi.info/) ‚Äî searching for ancient ruins in the Peruvian jungle using satellite data.
- [**Geospatial Grimoire**](https://geospatial-grimoire.com/) ‚Äî maps and 3D models for fantasy worlds.

## Education

I graduated from **Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK)**, Faculty of Applied Cosmonautics and Photogrammetry. I obtained a degree in **‚ÄúExploration of Natural Resources by Aerospace Methods.‚Äù** My thesis focused on the design of geodynamic monitoring of hydrocarbon fields using lineament analysis. In addition, I am a **Google Cloud** certified specialist in data, machine learning, and cloud architectures.
