Hi! My name is Yaroslav, and this is my personal website. I created it to bring together everything I work on in one place: my professional experience, research, open projects, and interesting ideas.

My work revolves around **geospatial and cloud technologies**, but beyond that, I apply my skills to diverse projects â€” from **searching for ancient settlements in the Peruvian jungle** to **mapping imaginary worlds**. Here, you can learn more about me, my projects, and my publications.

For now, the blog is empty, but in the future, I might share thoughts on my career, research, technology, or just interesting findings. If these topics resonate with you, stay tuned!
